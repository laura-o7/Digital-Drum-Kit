# Digital-Drum-Kit

This is a digital drum kit created using a combination of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

By clicking the instruments displayed on the buttons, the site will play the corresponding sound of that instrument, allowing the user to play a full drum kit.

Alternatively, the corresponding instrument sounds can also be played by using the keyboard keys displayed on the buttons as the digital drum kit can also detect key presses.
